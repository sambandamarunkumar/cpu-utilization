### Abstract
The paper proposes an AI-driven adaptive scaling framework to overcome the limitations of reactive, rule-based autoscaling in distributed cloud systems by predicting workload fluctuations
and proactively adjusting resources in real time. By integrating predictive analytics with reinforcement learning, the framework continuously monitors system metrics such as CPU utilization, 
latency, and workload intensity to make intelligent scaling decisions before performance degradation occurs. Extensive experiments conducted on clustered environments with varying sizes and workload 
types demonstrate consistent response time improvements of approximately 35–44% compared to traditional scaling approaches. The results confirm that predictive, learning-based scaling significantly 
reduces queuing delays, avoids over-provisioning, and improves energy efficiency. Overall, the study establishes AI-driven adaptive scaling as an effective and sustainable solution for responsive 
and efficient workload management in modern distributed cloud systems

### Key Contributions
